# Purpose

The purpose for this section is to go over Python's built-in collections.

In this section, I will be utilizing [Python 3.10](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#) version of documentation unless otherwise explicitly stated.

In some instances, I may have already provided training. In which case, it will be linked within the Jupyter notebook.
