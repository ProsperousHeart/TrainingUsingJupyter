    "\n",
    "This will create a **file** object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file object = open(file_name [, access_mode][, buffering])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**file_name**\n",
    "A string value that contains the name of the file that you want to access. (It can include the full path on your local system as well.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**access_mode**\n",
    "Determines the mode with which to open the file with. This is an _optional_ parameter, and the default access mode is read (`r`).\n",

    "| Modes | Description |\n",
    "|----------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| r | Opens a file for **reading only**. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. _(default mode)_ |\n",
    "| r+ | Opens a file for **both reading & writing**. File pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. |\n",
    "| w | Opens a file for **writing only** ... Ovewrwrites if the file exists, otherwise creates a new file. |\n",
    "| w+ | Opens a file for **both writing & reading** ... Ovewrwrites if the file exists, otherwise creates a new file for writing and reading. |\n",
    "| a | Opens a file for **appending** with the pointer at the end of the file, if it exists. If file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing. |\n",
    "| a+ | Opens a file for **both appending and reading** with the pointer at the end, if the file exists. If file does not exist, a new one is created for reading/writing. |\n",
