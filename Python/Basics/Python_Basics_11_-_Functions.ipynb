    "# What Is A Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions are a block of **organized**, reusable code used to perform a single, related action. It provides for better modularity & a higher degree of code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "I touch more on this in my presentation \"[How To Think Like A Programmer](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6475399796298444800)\" (Dec 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some functions are built into python and it's data objects, while others are user-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are always called by something, for example but not limited to:\n",
    "- another method or function\n",
    "- variable\n",
    "\n",
    "# How Do You Define A Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example (pseudo-code):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name():\n",
    "    \"\"\"function docstring\"\"\"\n",
    "    # function suite\n",
    "    return [expression, ...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each function is made up of 5 parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The _def_ line**\n",
    "\n",
    "This line starts with the **def** or define keyword followed by the name of the function and a set of parenthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Optional Input Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the requirements of your function, you may have input parameters with which may be needed to complete the function's design. There may be 0 or more input parameters that you can force or make optional.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Docstring**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many suggested ways to do documentation ...\n",
    "\n",
    "- [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) from Python Developer's Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "- Geeks For Geeks on [docstring](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-docstrings/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python For Beginners on [docstring](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/python-docstrings)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hitchhiker's Guide to Python on [docstring](https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/documentation/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- RealPython's [Complete Guide To Python Documentation](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/)\n",
    "\n",
    "... and some work well with modules that created an outprint of said documentation!the func\n",
    "\n",
    "But at the bare minimum, at least explain:\n",
    "- what the function does\n",
    "- how the input variables are used\n",
    "- if it returns something, what?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The Code Block**\n",
    "\n",
    "This starts after the `:` and (unless it's a single line function) is indented on a new line by 4 spaces. This is the piece of code that actually does the computations/changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **The Return**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you never utilize the `return` statement to send data back, then if you attempt to call the function and store it in a variable? You would get back `None` as the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def temp_func():\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    This function prints a statement explanation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    print('This \"returns\" None. Even if you used \"return\" or \"return None\"')\n",
    "\n",
    "temp_data = temp_func()\n",

    "## Arguments:  Pass By Reference vs Value\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining a function, all parameters (aka arguments) are passed by reference. Meaning the function has a local scope variable that refers to that piece of data. But this can be very dangerous, if not also confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**REMEMBER:**  a variable is simply a label that points to a particular piece in your computer's memory that holds some data set._\n",
