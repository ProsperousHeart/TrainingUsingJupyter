## What's Missing?

This is not entirely complete. I am still working through the main details, but what is currently missing is:
- how to [setup your environment variables](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Processes/SetEnvVars.md)
- how to [setup a virtual environment](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Tools/VirtualEnvironments.md) (process is [here](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Processes/virtualenvs.md))

At some point I will bring those pieces into this training, but for now I've at least provided links to my cheatsheets data for you.

# About Me

## Why I Got Into Programming

I love being able to create something from nothing that helps other people.

I love being told "that's impossible" - and proving people wrong.

## Some Technical Background Info

I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2008 from my alma mater [TCU](https://www.tcu.edu).

As of early 2019, I have taught myself python, trained hundreds (possibly thousands at this point) of interested developers, and created projects from scratch to be able to not only collect data but provide it in a data-driven storytelling way.

Or to be less fancy, I created the back end and front end pieces from scratch to show stuff.

## Some Personal Background Info

I am passionate about empowering people to create greater success in their life.

That's why on top of continuing to learn new programming skills & experience, I have also:

1. started my own business as a digital marketing agency with a larger focus on Facebook, blogging, SEO & YouTube (mostly coaching, but I do offer done for you services)

    - [Blog](https://mlsp.co/l7gno)
    - [Facebook](https://www.prosperousheart.com/PH-facebook-page)
    - [YouTube](https://mlsp.co/l7fy7)
    - [Instagram](https://mlsp.co/l7fxt) - though I'm rarely on here

2. Began learning forex, sharing my journey, teaching what I'm learning, and inviting others to use the same tools & resources I do to cut their learning curve. (Contact my FB page below for more info.)

    - [Facebook](https://mlsp.co/l7fwu) - and for a free 5 day forex basics bootcamp, send my page:  5dbc
    - [YouTube](http://youtube.wealthninja.biz)
    - [Instagram](https://mlsp.co/l7ja6)

I also really enjoy:
- singing
- my little fur baby Dyson (a Dachshund mix)
- bringing a smile to others
