    "- attributes for maintaining the object's state (e.g.:  eye color, name, etc)\n",
    "- methods (functions that can be run against the instance) for modifying it's state\n",

    "4. namespace with built-in names\n",
    "\n",
    "If a name (label) is declared global, then all references (pointers) and assignments (changing of data) have their namespace starting in that 3rd layer - the layer containing a module's global names.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to access variables outside the local (level 1) scope, you need to indicate so with the `nonlocal` statement in front of the variable name. If you do not utilize either this [nonlocal](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) or [global](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) statement, the original variables become **read-only** and an attempt to overwrite the original data will simply create a _new_ local variable int he innermost scope leaving original unchanged.\n",
