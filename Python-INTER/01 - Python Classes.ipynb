    "## Magic Methods (Dunders)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a term you will hear among many programmer groups. **magic methods** are special methods with double underscores at the beginning and end of their names. (*Also known as __dunder methods__!*)\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods allow you to create functionality that can't be represented in a normal method.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of methods available (such as those listed in [this article on GitHub](https://rszalski.github.io/magicmethods)) but the one you'll see most? Is the one that allows you to create an instance (or instantiate) an object of said class type.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `__init__`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__` dunder or magic method is the most important method within a class. This is the function of the class object that is called when an instance of the object is instantiated or created.\n",
    "\n",
    "All `__init__` methods __must__ start with __*self*__ as the first parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "_NOTE:  This parameter indicates to Python that when calling __self__ you are referring to the INSTANCE that is calling the method, vs making a change to all instances._\n",

    "```python\n",
    "class Wood_Cup:\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",

    "    def __init__(self, wood_type_obj = None, size = None, art_class_obj = None, handle_loc = \"R\", staves = 0):\n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        This is the __init__ method which allows someone to create an instance of the Wood_Cup class.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        This function determines what attributes each instance of the class will have.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \"\"\"\n",
    "        \n",
    "        self.staves = staves\n",

    "        self.staves = staves\n",
    "        self.size = size\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating or instantiating a new instance of a class, you do not need to add *__self__* as an input parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such as:  `new_cup = Wood_Cup(\"birch\", \"B\", None, \"L\", 8)`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of built-in methods for classes that can really help to clean up your code as well as make it more pliable."

    "Every time you create a class object, you create an _instance_ of that object ... Meaning a piece of code with the same attributes as other instances of that class type, but are not referring to the same piece of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each instance of a class has a set of attributes, or pieces of data associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when thinking of creating classes, think of all the base attributes. For example ...\n",
