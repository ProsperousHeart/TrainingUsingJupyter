    "A project schedule is critical to communicating time constraints. IT goes through an example instance of a project that a prior PM put in place (now \"overdue\") and walks you through how to leverage different aspets (_e.g.: dependencies, lag, lead_) to validate the information in MS Project to work through setting up an accurate schedule. It will cover how to find issues to fix, techniques for slack & critical path to work through."
