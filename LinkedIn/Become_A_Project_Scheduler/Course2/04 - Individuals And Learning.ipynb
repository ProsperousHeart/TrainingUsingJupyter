    "When a change is introduced to an orgniazation, it frequently means that people need to learn something new.\n",

    "Common approach to defining what is to be learned is to identify the knolwedge, skills, and attitudes required from the learners. This new knowledge could be regulations ties to their job or ability to use a new software.\n",

    "Your job as the PM is to work with the change manager to create the learning plan based on your knowledge of the products being delivered & schedule for delivery.\n",

    "**[Kolb's cycle](https://www.simplypsychology.org/learning-kolb.html)** (later adopted by Honey & Mumford) is a great tool to help with planning learning. It suggests that in order for true learning to be achieved, all 4 stages of the cycle need to be experienced in any order. People move through the stages via a chance in behavior.\n",

    "Honey & Mumford took the theory further saying individuals have a preference towards a particular learning style. But being exposed to other learning styles may consolidate their learning.\n",

    "3. **Theorist** - attracted to _abstract conceptualization_. They're generally happy to read up on topics, attend a seminar, conference, or lecture to elarn more\n",
