    "For change to happen, people first need to WANT it to happen. They must feel motivated & that the reward is worth it.\n",

    "As a PM, you will need to know how to continually motivate your team & users during the project.\n",

    "[Herzberg's Motivation Theory](https://www.simplypsychology.org/herzbergs-two-factor-theory.html) can be helpful in keeping people motivated. His study noted that job satisfactikno stemmed from a set of motivators, which when used caused people to take action and make change. These motivators are:\n",
    "- achievement\n",
    "- recognition\n",
    "- responsibility\n",
    "- advancement\n",
    "- learning\n",
    "- type & nature of work\n",
    "\n",
    "He also noted a set of hygiene factors that employees expected from their employer & were rarely successful in motivating people. These factors are:\n",
    "- pay\n",
    "- company policy\n",
    "- quality of supervision\n",
    "- working relations\n",
    "- working conditions\n",
    "- status\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a lack of (or withdrawal) of these hygiene factors would lead to dissatisfaction & a lack of motivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking these observations into account, here are some ways to motivate people:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Provide recognition** when it's due - either for an individual or a team\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create visibility** - keep the project highly visible & celebrate the prouject's successes (helps team members feel a sense of achievement in how their efforts contribute to the project objectives)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Build in variety** - keep the work varied! Be a proactive manager of hte team, providing challenges & coaching to help the team acquire new skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Offer opportunities for growth**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Acknoweldge individual contributions**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Delegate responsibility** to those who earn it & avoid micromanagement"

    "- formal weekly team report (good for audit trail)\n",
    "- email or phone call update every few days (less formal but likely more appropriate with a highly skilled team)\n",
    "- daily standup (highly collaborative & transparent - usually conducted in front of team board)\n",
