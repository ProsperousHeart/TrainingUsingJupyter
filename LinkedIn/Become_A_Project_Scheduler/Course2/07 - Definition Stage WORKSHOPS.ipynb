    "- define requirements\n",
    "- create plans\n",
    "- gather ideas\n",
    "- resolve issues\n",
    "- create plans\n",

    "This will outline some skills to help keep your workshop & project on track.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Active Listening.** Listen to others first. Really hear what the speaker is saying. _Listening first earns the right to be heard ourselves._\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Be present** & genuinely interested in what is being said. This breaks down hostility and barriers.\n",
    "    - **Pay attention to body language.** Listen with your eyes - what body language do you observe when the other person is talking? Are you picking p on any hidden messages that give yo clues on their position?\n",
    "    - **Ask questions.** Listen with your instincts - sometimes you can sense when someone is holding back. Gently ask questiosn that lead them to open up.\n",
    "    - **Try to understand how they feel.** Listen with your heart - what do you think they are feeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Empathy** - recognizing others' emotions & having the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes. To effective use empathy, you need to practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Seeing things from the other person's perspective.\n",
    "    - Validate their perspective.\n",
    "    - Consider your attitude. Are you concerned with finding a solution or being right? Have an open mind & attitude to others' opinions.\n",
    "    - Actively listen.\n",
    "    - Ask what they want."
