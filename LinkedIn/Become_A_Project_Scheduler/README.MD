These notes will be for my personal use, but I am sharing on GitHub to show I have taken the courses. I utilize my local library for access to LinkedIn Learning.

I highly suggest going through these courses yourself vs relying on my notes. If there was information I was already aware of, I did not include it here.

These notes should not be taken as a comprehensive training tool, but merely a guideline or cheatsheet regarding the knowledge shared.
