    "I have always been fascinated with the bottom line, improving efficiency, eliminating wasted time, and ensuring the best I possibly can for my \"end customer\" ... But with how fast data is being processed and the progression of technology, the need for data retrieval and analysis has also increased.\n",

    "That's where a data scientist comes in!\n",

    "The training provided here can be found anywhere online. However, a good bulk of this training was utilized by going through the following Udemy courses:\n",

    "\n",
    "[Pandas](https://www.python-course.eu/pandas.php) is an acronymn & stands for \"Panel Data Structures\". This is used by economists, statisticians, econometricians, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas is a library built **on top** of NumPy, which is built on the [Python programming language](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/TrainingUsingJupyter/tree/master/Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries are a bundle of features and add-ons to the base language. Each one has it's own focus (specialty). \n",
    "\n",
    "For **pandas**? It's <font color=green>data analysis</font>.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a robust toolkit analyzing, filtering, manipulating, aggregating, merging, pivoting, and cleaning data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also been known as *\"Excel for Python\"* or even \"Excel on steroids\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why it is better than Excel or Google Sheets is because it can calculate data on 10s of 1,000s of rows of data within **seconds**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional items of note:\n",
    "- Pandas is an open source library built on top of NumPy\n",
    "- It allows for fast analysis & data cleaning/preparation\n",
    "- exxcels in performance & productivity- built-in visualization features\n",
    "- can work with data from a wide variety of sources\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic knowledge of spreadsheet software - since it's basically what you're working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic understanding of data types (text, strings, integers, floats, Booleans). - You can easily get this by checking out my training on [python](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/TrainingUsingJupyter/tree/master/Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommended\n",
    "\n",
    "Strong knowledge of spreadsheet software for pivots, vlookups, functions, etc. Really all that's needed is a knowledge of how to manipulate data in a spreadsheet.\n",

    "# Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Must have **python&& and **pandas** installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas library is dependent on other python libraries in order to run, so it's just easiest to install the \"suite\".\n",
    "\n",
    "It is **_highly recommended_** you install Python using the [Anaconda distribution](https://anaconda.org) to make sure all underlying dependencies (such as Linear Algebra libraries) all sync up with the use of a conda install. It bundles:\n",
    "- Python\n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "- 100+ data analysis libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, you will use the Terminal/Command Line to update libraries and install additional ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "If installing to your terminal ([Anaconda](#anaconda-installation) should already have them) you can install pandas by going to your terminal or command prompt and typing one of the following (depending on your environment):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    conda install pandas\n",
    "    pip install pandas\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you do not have Anaconda and can not install it, **please refer to [Numpy's official documentation on various installation instructions.](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/user/install.html)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Development Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install) (originally known as iPython) in order to do our development work.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the same infrastructure that you are reading this training on.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a bit different from the typical coding editor, as it consists of cells. Each cell can contain code or text that can be shown in markdown language (such as what you're reading). You are then able to execute cell, and right below each executed block of code you can see the result of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This encourages a trial & error approach to solving problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you would like to find a gallery of intersting Python notebooks, you can Google [sample Jupyter notebooks](https://www.google.com/search?q=sample+jupyter+notebooks&rlz=1C1NDCM_enUS702US702&oq=sample+jupyter+notebooks&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2.7724j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) and the first two links that pop up will show you what is possible.\n",

    "Some cool things you can embed into a Jupyter notebook:\n",

    "\n",
    "You may see one for Python 2.7 but remember - a lot of the PYthon 3 version made the v2 code invalid.\n",

    "The reason it supports multiple \"sandboxes\" is so that different users can play around with different versions of libraries and languages. It also allows the user to see how different libraries play with each other.\n",
