    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook, I will be covering how I have used the amazing [XLSXWriter](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is also [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), I really liked XLSXWriter much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are MANY ways to use this, I am going to cover how I use it to:\n",
    "- read in an excel file\n",
    "- create a new excel file\n",
    "- some formatting\n",
    "- centering columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to [read the docs](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/) for additional things not covered here.\n",
    "\n",
    "One last thing - the structure of the code here is for educational purposes. If this were a real program, I would structure this a lot differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages & Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "As per [this link](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/introduction.html), XlsxWriter is a python module for **writing** files in the Excel 2007+ XLSX file format. It can be used to write text, numbers, and formulas to multiple worksheets and it supports features such as formatting, images, charts, page setup, autofilters, conditional formatting and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the advantages and disadvantages over [alternative Python modules](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io/alternatives.html#alternatives) for writing Excel files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**\n",
    "- It supports more Excel features than any of the alternative modules.\n",
    "- It has a high degree of fidelity with files produced by Excel. In most cases the files produced are 100% equivalent to files produced by Excel.\n",
    "- It has extensive documentation, example files and tests.\n",
    "- It is fast and can be configured to use very little memory even for very large output files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**\n",
    "- It cannot read or modify existing Excel XLSX files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need the following to be installed:\n",
    "- python 3\n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "- xlsxwriter\n",
    "- xlrd\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip3 install pandas`\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip3 install XlsxWriter`\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip3 install xlrd`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't already have a [virtual environment](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Tools/VirtualEnvironments.md) created, please do so now. You can even [use my cheat sheet](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/cheatsheets/blob/master/Processes/virtualenvs.md). Inside this virtual environment is where you should install **pandas** and **xlsxwriter** ... The reason for this is not every project can use some of the later versions of packages, so you want to ensure you don't cause issues later down the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this walkthrough, I also provide a CSV file `AirQualityUCI.csv` that will allow us to populate data in the 1st tab. This comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality) and covers air quality from March 2004 to February 2005. While we will not necessarily be using this data for any other purpose other than how to use XLSXWriter, this is what the data entails:\n",
    "- 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an air quality chemical multisensor device\n",
    "- device was located in a significantly polluted area at road level in an Italian city\n",
    "- Ground Truth hourly averaged concentrations for:\n",
    "    1. CO2\n",
    "    2. SNO - tin oxide\n",
    "    3. NMHC - Non Metanic Hydrocarbons in micrograms\n",
    "    4. C6H6 - Benzene (micrograms)\n",
    "    5. TIO2 - titanium dioxide\n",
    "    6. NOX - Total Nitrogen Oxides (ppb)\n",
    "    7. WOX - Tungsten oxide\n",
    "    8. NO2 - Nitrogen Dioxide (microgram)\n",
    "- includes date & time\n",
    "\n",
    "The second file I will use to show how you can create multiple tabs will be the `ionosphere.data.csv` file. This is from the Johns Hopkins University Ionosphere database, thanks to [Vince Sigillito](mailto:vgs@aplcen.apl.jhu.edu) in 1989. It is the classification of radar returns from the ionosphere using neural networks. It contains an array of 16 high-frequency antennas with a total transmitted power of 6.4 kilowatts, with the targets being free electrons in the ionosphere."
