    "As a programmer, it is your job to:\n",
    "- think of all the ways in which a user might break your code\n",
    "- determine next piece to complete based on timeline of the business unit\n",
    "- code in such a way that someone behind you can easily pick up where you left off\n",

    "- ensure that all consumers (end users & programmers) have an easy experience with your product\n",

    "## Print Or Utilize Logging - A LOT\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the easiest ways to ensure you are leveraging the different options to print or use logging is covered in my previous talk on [How To Think Like A Programmer](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6475399796298444800) regarding creating a \"bare bones\" script. While you may not keep up with as much detail as this outlines as your script progresses, this foundational setup will help you with troubleshooting in the future. So I highly suggest doing your best to follow the guidelines given.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that same training's [code](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Cisco-Live-2018/STEP3-Functions.py#L12), I provided additional information on two ways to leverage the logging module:\n",
    "- via console\n",
    "- via logging file creation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Should You Use PRINT Or The Logging Module So Much?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons to leverage this module. Can you think of more?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It confirms you have received expected date input for a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It confirms you have sent expected output when a function was called.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Provides you the opportunity to minimize time to resolution by breaking down where and why you're broken down.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Can check if you're hitting expected code or not (and determine why if not)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Provides you the ability to notice strange behaviors (e.g.:  an error message keeps appearing even though you put the block of code in a try-except block, so script keeps going with incorrect data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ideas On How To Effectively Use Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Think of your logging as a catch-all for you to be able to troubleshoot your script. Obviously you want to clean it up later for production code, but this is your first step. IF you keep this in mind, then finding and fixing bugs in the future will become a lot easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Be sure to do the starting and ending lines of a function as outlined in \"[How To Write A Bare Bones Script](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6475399796298444800)\" - this will allow you to see when your script enters and exits a function. Easier to track through your debugging. **ALTERNATE:  _You can put it before and after calling the function instead._**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When using [logger module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html), be sure to enable it to go all the way to the debug level. This provides you many different ways to provide logs - including writing scripts that only show certain log levels as requested by the person pulling logs. I utilize logging 2 different ways in my code [here](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/Personal-Projects/blob/master/Cisco-Live-2018/semibasic-final.py#L24) & provide additional information in the comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Using **logger.info('Something here')** allows you to choose INFO level lines, such as to confirm information being sent/received between functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once you've confirmed a function is working as expected, **at least** comment out the logging lines so they don't clutter up your output for additional troubleshooting. You can always uncomment them later as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Not Always Use Print?\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the environment, print may not be your best option. It's a quick & dirty way to do your troubleshooting, but using the logging module allows for more flexibility - as well as a better way for your end users to leverage the debugging features in your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g.:  Cisco logging requires you to turn on certain logging features to get the logs for what you need when troubleshooting so TAC can assist"

    "\n",
    "By reusing someone else's code, it also provides you a unique opportunity to see other coding styles, including how to be more efficient with your own code (like using [list comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) and [dictionary comprehensions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0274)).\n",
