# How To Code In JavaScript

You will need a code editor. One suggestion is to use [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [atom-live-server](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server) extension. This extension spins up a small web server on your machine and sends any changes made on the project to the browser on the fly.

Whie the Atom add-on isn't required, it streamlines the process and makes working with the editor & browser at the same time a much more pleasant experience.
