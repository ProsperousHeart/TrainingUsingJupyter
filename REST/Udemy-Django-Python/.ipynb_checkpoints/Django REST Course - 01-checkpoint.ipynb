    "\n",
    "As a programmer, I have always found it so frustrating when APIs are written poorly, have incorrect or hard to follow documentation, or quite simply was just non-existant! So I decided to start learning how to create my own in order to create an app for my mom's business.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training provided here can be found anywhere online. However, a good bulk of this training was utilized by going through the following Udemy courses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Build Your Own Backend REST API using Django REST Framework](https://www.udemy.com/django-python)\n",
    "\n",
    "This documentation will provide information on how to create a RESTful API using python and django. REST APIs are a critical component for any application - especially mobile!\n",
    "\n",
    "This will walk you through creation of an API to provide the following features:\n",
    "- user profile registration & update\n",
    "- login and authentication\n",
    "- posting status updates\n",
    "- viewing other profiles & updates\n",
    "\n",
    "These features are available in most mobile web applications.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "1. VirtualBox\n",
    "2. Vagrant\n",
    "3. python\n",
    "4. django\n",

    "## Development Server\n",
    "\n",
    "Many developers run code on their local OS. This can cause a numer of issues when working on real world apps, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- difficult to work collaboratively\n",
    "- different software on different platforms (Windows, Mac, etc)\n",
    "- conflict with other apps used\n",
    "- clogs up system with dev tools & packages\n",
    "- different OS from the server\n",
    "\n",
    "Professional programmers always write their code on a local DEV server to isolate their code from their local desktop. This is best practice and will be achieved using the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Vagrant - allows you to describe what kind of server you need for your app, and then save as a Vagrant file. Allows you to easily reproduce and share with other developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. VirtualBox - used by Vagrant to create the virtual server exactly as described. (App code and requirements are installed on a virtual server.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Running code in a virtual dev machine has many benefits:\n",
    "- easy to share the server with others\n",
    "- regardless of OS, have exact same version of all requirements\n",
    "- can test code using exactly the same OS as a real PROD server\n",
    "- easily create and destroy the server as needed"

    "\n",
    "A web framework used on top of python. While most websites look differen ton the surface, there are a number of things they ALL have in common.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE:  most sites use data from a DB to render HTMLthat a browser can understand and translate to something that makes sense to most people - images, videos, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Django provides a pre-defined set of code we cna use to perform some of these common actions like:\n",
    "- interacting with the DB\n",
    "- returning pages and images\n",
    "- validation and form submissions\n",
    "\n",
