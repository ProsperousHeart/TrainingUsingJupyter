    "# Creating A Workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "A workspace is a directory on your machine that will host all of the files required for your project. **Organization** is what determines a good from great developer.\n",
    "\n",
    "He always creates his workspace in the home directory:  `workspace`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then create a shortcut to it in the **Quick ACcess** section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the *workspace* folder, create a directory for the project you will be working on. For the intent and purpose of this training, it should be titled:  `profiles-rest-api`\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended to NOT use spaces or capitalization since we will be using **git bash** to navigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also recommended to put it in the home, however if you [create a symbolic link](https://skimfeed.com/blog/symbolic-links-in-windows-for-pointing-a-folder-to-another-folder-on-an-external-hard-drive-or-ssd/) it won't matter where you put it. You will still be able to follow these steps exactly.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. open Windows menu and search for **git bash** - then open the program\n",
    "\n",
    "This is basically a replacement for the command prompt window, but gives a lot of linux online tools needed in this course. Also a lot easier to work with git projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use **ls** to list all files and folders in current location\n",

    "- `cd workspace`\n",
    "- `cd profiles-rest-api`\n",

    "The **git ignore** file tells git what files do NOT need to be added to git.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
