    "He always creates his workspace in the home directory:  `workspace`\n",

    "_Personally, I like to keep mine short due to Windows restrictions, so I have one called **code**_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping your project folder in a highler lever has many benefits, including ensuring there are less likely to be character limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then create a shortcut to it in the **Quick Access** section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the *workspace* folder, create a directory for the project you will be working on. For the intent and purpose of this training, it should be titled:  `profiles-rest-api`\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended to NOT use spaces or capitalization since we will be using **git bash** to navigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also recommended to put it in the home, however if you [create a symbolic link](https://skimfeed.com/blog/symbolic-links-in-windows-for-pointing-a-folder-to-another-folder-on-an-external-hard-drive-or-ssd/) it won't matter where you put it. You will still be able to follow these steps exactly.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. open Windows menu and search for **git bash** - then open the program\n",
    "\n",
    "This is basically a replacement for the command prompt window, but gives a lot of linux online tools needed in this course. Also a lot easier to work with git projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use **ls** to list all files and folders in current location\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the **cd** (change directory) command to navigate to the project folder:\n",
    "- `cd workspace`\n",
