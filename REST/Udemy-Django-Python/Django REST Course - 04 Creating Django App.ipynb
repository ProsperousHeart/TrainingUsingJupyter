    "# Create Python Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "A **virtual environment** is a virtual wrapper you can use to install python applications.It is a set of files which you work on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the below 2 options did not work. The origina creator's vagrant files had issues in bnoth the originally provided one and the one given to other students later int eh course with issues. I've had to tweak it since then. not sure if it is right, either. Need to test but so far [this one](https://github.com/ProsperousHeart/TrainingUsingJupyter/blob/master/REST/Udemy-Django-Python/profiles-rest-api/Vagrantfile) allowed me to move forward with option 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Option 1:  venv (built-in)\n",
    "\n",
    "Inorder to set up your virtual environment, you will need to connect to the Vagrant server in your **git bash** by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. going to your project directory\n",
    "2. running `vagrant ssh`\n",
    "3. change directory into the vagrant directory:  `cd /vagrant/`\n",
    "4. run:  `python -m venv PATH\\TO\\VIRTUAL\\ENV` such as `python -m venv ~/env`\n",
    "\n",
    "The directory in #4 is where all of the dependencies you install via the python package manager will be stored. In the above example, it will create a new folder in the Vagrant home directory. Doing it this way will set up the environemtn in the server and not sync it with your original machine. This way if you ever need to destroy & create the Vagrant server frm scratch you can do so with a fresh virtual environment.\n",

    "## Option 2:  virtualenv\n",
