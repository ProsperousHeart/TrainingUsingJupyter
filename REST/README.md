# What Is REST API?

REST stands for **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer.

API stands for **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface.

Both of these terms signify a way for applications to talk to each other.

Rather than having a human point and click workflow, an API exposes functionality to other applications.

These APIs create the opportunity to develop rich applications with a ride range of functionality. And thus allow developers to create apps that benefit the end user.

# REST More In Depth

REST is basically another use for HTTP protocol. REST services send all requests/responses over TCP/TLS connections using text.

How? Because REST is a framework built upon HTTP, where the interface points are often for web services.

REST API flow manages both requests and responses.
